# libft

In our first project at *42*, the **libft**, we were asked to create our own
library.

We had to recode some **basic functions** (like `memset` or `strncmp`), create
other **imposed ones** (like `itoa` or `strsplit`) and then add **personnal
functions** that can be usefull for the other C projects.

There's only *one function per file*.
